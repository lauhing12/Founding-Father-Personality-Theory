孤星之輝與自由的絕唱 ，六人四旗一推特,逼退二十萬大軍。
The Light of the Lone Star and the Swan Song of Freedom:
Six men, four flags, and a single tweet , they repelled an army of two hundred thousand

註¹：「二十萬大軍」為根據2019年多家媒體報導（包括路透社、CNN、衛星圖像與本地目擊者）對深圳—香港邊境之解放軍與武警集結數量的估算。該時段亦有中共公開軍演與裝甲車調動記錄。雖官方未承認具體兵力數字，惟本書以此象徵性語句呈現事件震撼性與戰略張力。

Note 1: “An army of two hundred thousand” refers to estimates by multiple international media outlets (including Reuters, CNN, and satellite imagery) of Chinese military and paramilitary troop deployments in the Shenzhen–Hong Kong border region during the 2019 protests. While exact numbers were never officially confirmed by Chinese authorities, the symbolic phrase reflects the magnitude of military readiness at the time, and the extraordinary geopolitical pressure that followed the international response.

六個年輕人，六個燃燒的靈魂，站在維多利亞港的風中，
舉起了改變歷史的一面旗。 2019年，一個動盪的夏夜，
尖沙咀星光大道依舊璀璨，遊客拍照、霓虹閃爍，但空氣中瀰漫著異樣的壓抑感。中環的高樓倒映在海面上，如同這座城市最後的輝煌。 六個大學生，來自不同的學校，不同的家庭，卻因為這場運動聚在一起。 他們知道，這可能是最後的機會。他們的未來或許會被撕裂，但今天，他們必須讓世界看到。 其中一人，站在最前方，雙手高舉著一面美國國旗，星條交錯，在海風中翻飛。旁邊的女孩，手持黑色標語：「FREE HONG KONG」。另一人戴著頭盔與防毒面具，象徵著過去幾個月以來的戰鬥。
六個人肩並肩站立，眼神堅定，望向鏡頭，望向世界。 然後，他們開口唱了起來。 
「O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light...」
 他們的聲音顫抖，卻不曾退縮。美國國歌的旋律在維港上空回盪，不遠處的群眾起初愣住，然後漸漸有人跟著低聲附和。一個、兩個、三個……數百人在這個香港的夜晚，一起唱起美國國歌，聲音彷彿穿透高樓，直達彼岸的中環，甚至抵達太平洋的彼岸，天上的主宰彷彿也在微笑看着他們，因為此夜就似冥冥中的安排，必然發生 這不是一張照片，而是一段直播的歷史。 站在不遠處的FOX記者，拿起手機，將鏡頭對準這一幕。閃光燈閃爍，YouTube、Facebook、Twitter、Telegram上的直播瞬間瘋傳。 這支影片，一夜之間傳遍全球。 推特上，這段影片開始瘋傳。 有人痛罵他們是「叛徒」、「賣國賊」，有人高呼支持，也有人難以置信地看著這場歷史性的畫面。這條訊息穿過演算法的洪流，直達美國總統特朗普的私人手機。 @realDonaldTrump 轉發了這段影片！ 「這些年輕人正在為自由而戰！美國與香港站在一起！中國不應該重蹈天安門的覆轍！」 ——@realDonaldTrump 美國國會開始加速推動《香港人權與民主法案》，FOX,CNN主播激動地討論：「特朗普是否會進一步制裁中國？這是否代表美國即將採取行動？」五角大樓的幕僚們開始分析局勢，白宮的戰略顧問匯報可能的後果。 而在北京，中南海內部的會議室燈火通明，國務院的高官與軍方將領激烈爭論。 「現在動手，國際金融制裁將毀滅中國經濟！」 「美軍已經關注此事，開槍的話，他們可能會派遣航母群到南海！」 深圳邊境的裝甲車已經集結，但幾個小時後，卻傳來了撤退的命令，六人四旗一推特，逼退了二十萬大軍 

 

【《易經．乾卦》初九】
潛龍勿用。

香港，暫時得救了。 然而，歷史的風暴終究不會停止。 運動結束後，國安法的陰影降臨。六個年輕人的名字出現在追捕名單上。 有人被捕，有人逃亡，有人被迫隱姓埋名。最後，三個人成功流亡到加拿大，但他們的名字已經被遺忘，當年的榮耀變成無人提起的往事。 這支影片，在世界瘋傳了幾個月，然後被新的新聞蓋過。

美國人繼續忙於選舉、貿易戰和內部紛爭，香港，逐漸從世界的焦點消失。 溫哥華的冬夜寒冷如鐵，遠離故鄉的三人，在異鄉艱難求生。 他們在唐人街的餐館打零工，在社區學院重新開始，在這片寒冷的土地上努力存活。沒有人記得他們，沒有人關心他們的故事。但他們知道，自己曾經改變歷史，即使這個世界，早已不再關心那場曾經震動全球的夜晚。 

某個秋日的午後，他們三人坐在溫哥華的港灣，望著海面。天邊的美國軍艦偶爾駛過，他們沉默良久，最後，一人低聲說了一句： 「我們曾經做到過。」 遠方的手機螢幕上，YouTube演算法推送了一支舊影片。 畫面裡，六個年輕人在尖沙咀，高舉美國國旗，高聲唱著《The Star-Spangled Banner》。 海風吹過，帶走了這句話，也帶走了六個年輕人燃燒過的青春。 星條旗依舊飄揚，但他們，已不再是當年的戰士。 

老兵不死 只是凋零 

送給每一位曾經高舉星條旗的勇者by-無名香港抗爭者

Six young souls, burning bright, stood in the wind of Victoria Harbour,
 raising a flag that would alter the course of history.
It was a restless summer night in 2019.
 The Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui still glittered — tourists snapping photos, neon lights flickering —
 yet in the air hung an oppressive weight, an eerie stillness before a storm.
Across the water, the skyscrapers of Central cast their reflections like the city’s last glimmer of glory.
 Six university students — from different schools, different families — had gathered for one cause. They knew: this might be the final chance.
Their futures might be torn apart, but tonight,
 they had to make the world see.
One of them stepped forward, holding high a flag —
 the Stars and Stripes billowing in the sea breeze.
Beside him, a girl held a black placard: “FREE HONG KONG.”
 Another wore a helmet and gas mask,
 a living emblem of the months of street battles that had passed.
Six of them stood shoulder to shoulder,
 eyes resolute, staring into the camera —
 staring into the eyes of the world.
And then, they began to sing.
“O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light…”

Their voices trembled — but never wavered.
 The melody of the American national anthem echoed across Victoria Harbour,
 reverberating through the humid summer air.
 At first, the crowd stood frozen,
 bewildered by the surreal defiance.
 Then slowly, one by one,
 they began to join in — a murmur, a whisper,a rising chorus.
Dozens turned to hundreds. On this Hong Kong night,
 they sang not just a song,but a declaration —a republic of voices,
 facing the empire of silence.
The notes seemed to pierce through the skyscrapers of Central,
 traversing the Pacific, reaching the distant shores of liberty.
 It was as if some divine watcher smiled down from the heavens —
 for this night was not a coincidence. It was destiny.
This wasn’t a photo.This was history, live-streamed.
From a short distance away, a FOX News reporter raised her phone,
 capturing the scene —six youths, four flags, and a song for the ages.
 Flashbulbs lit up.
 And within minutes, the footage exploded across YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Telegram.
The clip went viral overnight. On Twitter, it ignited a storm.
Some called them traitors. Others hailed them as heroes.
 And many, speechless, simply watched —history unfolding in real time.
The algorithm had no choice.
 The clip reached the private phone of the President of the United States.
@realDonaldTrump retweeted it.
“These brave young people are fighting for freedom!
 America stands with Hong Kong!
 China must not repeat Tiananmen!”
 — @realDonaldTrump
The United States Congress fast-tracked the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.
 Anchors at FOX and CNN were electrified:
 “Will President Trump sanction China? Is America preparing for real action?”
At the Pentagon, analysts poured over the footage.
 At the White House, strategists briefed consequences.
Meanwhile in Beijing, lights burned deep into the night.
 In Zhongnanhai, top ministers and military generals debated fiercely:
“If we act now, financial sanctions will cripple the economy!”
 “The U.S. Navy is watching —
 fire the first shot, and an aircraft carrier might sail into the South China Sea!”
Armoured vehicles gathered at the Shenzhen border. But hours later —
 the retreat order was given.
Six students. Four American flags. One retweet.
 And two hundred thousand troops — stood down.
【《易經．乾卦》初九】
潛龍勿用。

Hong Kong was saved — for a moment.
 But the storm of history does not rest.When the protests faded, the shadows of the National Security Law fell upon the city.
 The names of those six young souls — once sung, now whispered — appeared on wanted lists. Some were arrested. Some vanished. Some fled.
In the end, three made it to Canada. But their names were forgotten.
 Their glory, a footnote drowned beneath the flood of newer news.
The video — once viral across the globe —
 was soon buried under election cycles, trade wars, and domestic chaos.
America moved on.And the world looked elsewhere.

In Vancouver, the winter nights cold like iron.
 Far from home, the three exiles struggled to survive. They washed dishes in Chinatown,
 took night classes in community colleges, and tried to hold onto a life
 on a land that had never heard their names.
No one remembered. No one cared.
But they knew. They knew that once — just once —
they had changed the course of history.
Even if the world no longer cared for that night that once shook the globe.
One quiet autumn afternoon,
 they sat by the harbour in Vancouver.The sea was still.
 Far off, a U.S. Navy ship drifted past the horizon.
No one spoke for a long time.Then, one of them said softly:
 “We did it, once.”
On a nearby phone screen, the algorithm — perhaps out of guilt, perhaps out of fate —
 resurfaced an old video.
Onscreen: six youths in Tsim Sha Tsui, waving American flags,
 singing The Star-Spangled Banner with burning eyes and trembling voices.
The wind blew across the sea,carrying the words,
 and with them, the last embers of six young lives once aflame.
The flag still waves. But they are no longer soldiers.
 They are ghosts.
 They are memory.
Old soldiers never die —They just fade away.
For every soul who once raised the Stars and Stripes in defiance.
 — From a nameless Hong Konger





司馬遷《史記·太史公自序》

「究天人之際，通古今之變，成一家之言。」
我不是什麼菁英學院出身，也不是中環律師樓的實習生。
 我出身Band 3的麗澤中學，童年在旺角劏房長大，電視收唔到訊號，冷氣漏水，窗外永遠是彌敦道的車聲與怒罵。
我唔識拉丁文，冇讀牛津，更唔懂哈佛的國際關係理論。
但我記得，第一次聽見《The Star-Spangled Banner》嗰句：「the land of the free and the home of the brave」時，我竟然眼濕濕。
因為我知道，這是我一生未曾擁有，但拼死渴望的東西。
寫這本書，不是為了投稿，不是為了比賽，而是因為我目前人在加拿大，失業、經濟困頓，Trudeau搞到通脹瘋漲，失業率奇高，移民多過職位。每日醒來望住天花板，我問自己：
 「我這樣漂泊，有否意義？」
 然後我記起，自己曾在歷史的現場親歷過風暴。

政治一向是我的興趣，由2012年反國教遊行、2014年雨傘革命的親身觀察、2019年高舉星條旗、勇退元朗白衣人，一路走來的經歷，令我與政治結下了不解之緣。
這些年來，我雖不曾有任何政治權力，但我的腳曾走過自由的火線，我的眼曾見過歷史的烈焰。
中美之間的大國對決，不是「國際關係」的議題，而是文明人格的碰撞。
 在全面戰爭的時鐘邁向午夜十二點之前，我想留下一本書。一本給兩個文明的情書
吾撰此書，實屬對中華，美利堅之深愛
我不是為了改變世界，而是因為證明
 「我們曾經為自由存在過。」 我們叫 ——香港人
“Once, we existed for liberty.
We were called — the people of Hong Kong.”








"To explore the bond between Heaven and man,
 To understand the transformations across past and present,
 To forge a voice of my own."
 — Sima Qian, Records of the Grand Historian
I am not some Ivy League graduate. Not an intern in a sleek law firm in Central.
 I come from Lai Chak Secondary School—Band 3.
 I grew up in a subdivided flat in Mong Kok, Where the TV never got reception, The air-con always leaked,
 And outside the window, it was always Nathan Road—cars, sirens, and shouting.
I don’t speak Latin.
 I never went to Oxford.
 I don’t understand the theories of international relations taught at Harvard.
 But I remember the first time I heard the line from The Star-Spangled Banner:
 “The land of the free and the home of the brave.”
 My eyes welled up.
 Because I knew— This was something I had never truly owned,
 But had longed for with all my life.
I did not write this book to enter a competition, Nor to chase recognition.
 I wrote it because, here I am in Canada— Unemployed, broke,
 Inflation soaring under Trudeau, Jobs disappearing, immigrants overflowing.
 Every morning I wake and stare at the ceiling and ask myself:
 “Is there meaning in this wandering?”
Then I remember: I have stood at the edge of history.
Politics has always been my passion.
 From marching against national education in 2012,
 To witnessing the Umbrella Movement in 2014,
 To raising the Stars and Stripes in 2019,
 To retreating from the white-shirted mob in Yuen Long.
 All these moments bound me to politics in ways I never chose, but could not escape.
Over the years, I held no political power—
 But my feet walked through the fireline of freedom,
 And my eyes saw the flames of history.
This clash between China and America—
 It is not merely about “international relations.” It is a collision of civilizations, Of moral character.Before the clock of total war strikes midnight, I want to leave behind this book—
 A love letter to two civilizations.
I did not write it to change the world.
 I wrote it to remember,
 That once, we existed for liberty.
 We were called — the people of Hong Kong.




國父人格，決定民族性：制度背後的集體心理塑形術
A Founder’s Nature Becomes the Nation
人們總喜歡講：「中國人就是這樣」、「美國人天生反骨」、「香港人奴性又叛逆」。
 但我認為，這些所謂的「民族性」，其實不是天生的，
 而是由開國者的人格與故事，長年累月所塑造出來的制度性心理。
 — 劉興宏
People love to say, “That’s just how the Chinese are,”
 or “Americans are born rebels,”
 or “Hongkongers are submissive yet rebellious.”
 But I believe so-called ‘national character’ isn’t born —
 it’s forged, over decades,
 by the personality and story of the Founding Fathers,
 embedded into the psyche through institutions.
 — LAU HING WANG




美國人為何崇尚自由？因為他們的國父選擇退位
Why do Americans cherish liberty?
Because their Founding Father chose to give up power.

華盛頓不是神，但他以「放棄權力」的姿態，讓全國人相信： 
領袖可以被尊敬，但不可神化； 權力可以被行使，但必須交棒； 
制度的基礎，不是血統，不是黨章，而是「我願意被制衡」。
於是美國人學懂了質疑、學懂了自治、學懂了「你話唔代表我話」。


Washington was no god. But by stepping down from power, he made an entire nation believe: a leader may be respected, but never worshipped; power may be exercised, but must be relinquished. 
The foundation of the republic was not lineage, not party charter, but the simple, profound creed: “I am willing to be checked.” 
In that moment, Americans learned how to question, how to govern themselves, how to say, “Your word is not my command.” Thus was born the soul of the republic—not through holy decree or royal descent, but through one man’s quiet retreat, a voluntary surrender of power back to the people. It was not a revolution. It was civilization’s farewell to tyranny.





中國人為何迷信權威？因為他們的國父從未離場

Why do Chinese people revere authority?
Because their founding father never left the stage.
毛澤東不只是政治領袖，更是歷史的化身。他寫詩、打仗、建黨、整人、立規——
 他既是皇帝，又是詩人，又是革命軍神，又是最後的歷史裁判。
這種人格讓全中國學會了：
「服從強者，就是生存之道」；
 「造反可以，但要先贏」；
 「制度是給人操控，不是給人信仰的」。
Mao Zedong was not just a political leader — he was the embodiment of history. He wrote poetry, fought wars, founded a party, purged his enemies, and set the rules. He was at once an emperor, a poet, a god of revolutionary war, and the final judge of history.
This personality taught the entire Chinese nation one thing:
 “To obey the strong is the way to survive.”
 “You may rebel — but only if you win.”
 “Institutions are tools to control people, not beliefs to be upheld.”


國父們的性格，是給整個民族的潛意識投射
美國人骨子裡有一種「我可以不服你，但我服我建立嘅制度」的執念；


中國人則潛藏一種「制度只是手段，真正要看誰坐喺上面」的想法。


這不是因為他們基因不同，而是因為國父人格不同，故事不同，制度也就不同。

所以——民族性，不是宿命，而是歷史軌跡的副產品。
國父們留下的，不是雕像、憲章、詩詞，
 而是一整套「怎樣做人」的範式，經由學校、語言、歷史課本、電影、典故……
 一代一代，悄悄灌進國民的靈魂裡。
當我們看著中美兩國今日的對抗， 我們看到的，不只是航母與關稅、黨章與憲法，而是兩位國父，在歷史深處，繼續用他們的性格，塑造各自民族的命運。





The personalities of the founding fathers are projections of an entire nation’s subconscious.

 Deep in their bones, Americans carry an obsession:
 “I may not submit to you,
 but I submit to the system I helped build.”
The Chinese, by contrast, carry a hidden belief:
 “The system is merely a tool — what matters is who sits on top.”
This is not because their genes are different,
 but because their founding fathers were different,
 their stories were different,
 and so their systems became different.
Therefore — national character is not destiny.
 It is the byproduct of historical trajectory.
What the founding fathers left behind
 were not just statues, charters, or poems,
 but a complete model of “how to be a person” —
 instilled quietly, generation by generation,
 through schools, through language, through history classes, through films, through myths.
When we look at today’s confrontation between China and America,
 we are not merely seeing aircraft carriers and tariffs, party charters and constitutions —
 we are seeing two founding fathers,
 still, from the depths of history,
 shaping their nations’ destinies through the force of their personalities.
