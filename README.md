Author 作者  劉興邦（劉興宏） / Laughing Bond（Lau Hing Wang）
此書乃 老子,鳩摩羅什,文王與我 四人合著
This book is co-authored by four souls across time:
Laozi, Kumārajīva, King Wen of Zhou, and myself.
Rescued by the great Mahāyāna lifeboat of Canada, I now dwell in Vancouver.
Once a remnant of Hong Kong, I lived through the collapse of an age.
In those days, when the great edifice of the city was crumbling, the Stars and Stripes rose high — and I vowed never to fall into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.
Now exiled in the western forests of the maple leaf,
I spend my nights reading the teachings of the Founding Fathers,
And my mornings reciting the Diamond Sutra.

As Han Yu once wrote:
"A scholar may save a nation — without sword or spear."
